# Scoop Distribution

Scoop is the Windows counterpart of the Homebrew tap. Each publishing repo owns one manifest
template; the release pipeline renders it and pushes the result into `xberg-io/scoop-bucket`.
The bucket is generated output — never hand-edit `bucket/*.json` there, because the next
release of the owning repo overwrites it wholesale.

Per repo:

- `scripts/publish/scoop.json` — which manifests to render, and which release asset each SHA
  placeholder binds to
- `scripts/publish/<app>.json.tmpl` — the manifest template
- a `publish-scoop-manifest` job, mirroring `publish-homebrew-formula` in the same workflow

## The two escaping traps

Templates are rendered with Python `string.Template.substitute`, so **every literal `$` in the
manifest must be doubled**. Two of them appear in every template:

- `"$$schema"` — a bare `"$schema"` is read as the placeholder `$schema` and raises `KeyError`,
  failing the render. Loud, so you find it immediately.
- `$$version` inside `autoupdate` — this is Scoop's own placeholder, expanded by Scoop when it
  detects a new release. A bare `$version` there is **not** an error: it renders to the current
  release's version and silently freezes `autoupdate` on it forever.

The second is the one that bites, because a frozen `autoupdate` looks correct in review and in
the rendered manifest. Assert on it: the published `autoupdate` block must still contain a
literal `$version`, while the top-level `architecture` URLs must contain a concrete number.

## `extract_dir` cannot be derived

The repos do not package their Windows zips identically, and there is no rule that maps an asset
name to its inner layout. Get this wrong and `bin` resolves to nothing — the manifest hashes and
validates perfectly and installs a broken shim.

| App | Zip layout | `extract_dir` |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| `xberg` | nested, dir named after the asset | `xberg-cli-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| `crawlberg` | nested, dir named after the asset | `crawlberg-cli-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| `html-to-markdown` | nested, dir named after the asset | `cli-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| `liter-llm` | nested, **version in the dir name** | `liter-llm-${version}-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| `ts-pack` | **flat — the `.exe` is at the zip root** | omitted entirely |
| `alef` | nested, dir named after the asset | `alef-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |

Confirm with `unzip -l <asset>` against the actual release before trusting any of these; a repo
can change its packaging without anyone noticing the manifest went stale.

## Render locally instead of waiting for CI

A template change is cheap to verify end to end. This downloads the real asset, hashes it, and
writes the manifest exactly as the release job would:

```bash
git -C ../actions show origin/main:publish-scoop-manifests/scripts/render.py > /tmp/render.py
mkdir -p /tmp/bkt/bucket
GITHUB_WORKSPACE="$PWD" \
INPUT_BUCKET_DIR=/tmp/bkt \
INPUT_CONFIG_FILE="$PWD/scripts/publish/scoop.json" \
INPUT_TAG=v1.2.3 INPUT_VERSION=1.2.3 \
INPUT_GITHUB_REPO=xberg-io/<repo> INPUT_DRY_RUN=false \
python3 /tmp/render.py
```

Diff the result against the manifest currently in the bucket: for a released version it should
come out byte-identical, and for a new one the only change should be the version and hashes.
Set `INPUT_DRY_RUN=true` to render against a tag that does not exist yet — assets are replaced
with a zero-SHA placeholder and the run still succeeds, which is what the dry-run pipeline does.

## Adding `scoop` to a repo's targets

`release_scoop` comes from `alef release-metadata`, not from repo YAML. Two consequences:

- `alef`'s `ALL_RELEASE_TARGETS` must already contain `scoop`, **and a release carrying it must be
  published**, before any repo can name the target. `parse_targets` hard-fails on an unknown
  name, so adding `scoop` to an explicit `available-targets:` list too early breaks that repo's
  release outright.
- Repos that pass no `available-targets` default to all targets and need no edit. Repos that pass
  an explicit list must add `scoop` to it, but only after the alef release lands.

Until then the wiring is inert and harmless: `release_scoop` resolves to an empty string, the
job's gate is false, and the release report records the target as not enabled.

## Job shape

Copy the repo's own `publish-homebrew-formula` rather than inventing one — in particular its
five-attempt rebase/push loop. Six release pipelines push to the single shared bucket, so a
concurrent release can land between checkout and push and reject it as non-fast-forward. Each
repo touches only its own manifest, so rebasing onto the new tip and retrying is safe.

Two deliberate differences from the Homebrew job:

- **No `check-scoop` idempotency gate.** The render rewrites the manifest in place and the commit
  is guarded by `git diff --quiet bucket/`, so re-running a release is already a no-op. Pass no
  fourth argument to `require_publish` — there is no "already published" probe to consult.
- **The job runs on dry runs; only the commit step is skipped.** Dry-run renders are the only
  pre-release exercise the template gets. Gating the whole job on `dry_run != 'true'` removes
  that safety net.

## Native dependencies

Every CLI is a native MSVC build importing `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, so every manifest carries
`"suggest": {"vcredist": "extras/vcredist2022"}`.

Check the import table before adding an app — `llvm-objdump -p <exe> | grep 'DLL Name'`. A
third-party hard import that is not bundled in the zip produces a binary that cannot start at
all, and no amount of manifest correctness fixes it. `xberg.exe` imports `onnxruntime.dll` and
depends on its publish job vendoring the DLL closure into the archive; Scoop's shim resolves
DLLs from the app directory, so bundling is sufficient and no `depends` entry is needed. A
runtime lookup on `PATH` (Tesseract, for OCR) belongs in `notes`, not in `depends`.

## What actually proves an install works

Nothing on macOS or Linux does. Schema validation, a correct hash, and a byte-identical render
all pass on a manifest that installs a binary which cannot launch. The only real proof is the
`windows-latest` job in the bucket's `validate-manifests.yml`, which adds the checkout as a
bucket, installs each changed app, and runs `<app> --version`. Treat a green local check as
"nothing is obviously wrong", not as "this installs".
