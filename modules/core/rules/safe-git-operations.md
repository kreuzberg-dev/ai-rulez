Never force-push to shared branches. Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` when a force push is explicitly approved. Confirm destructive operations with the user.

Never run `git stash` when sibling agents may be active in the same repo — the stash stack is repo-global, not worktree-local, so a concurrent `stash`/`stash pop` can hand one agent's changes to another. Never run `git checkout -- <path>`, `git reset`, or `git clean` to "undo" a file with other agents running; restore a single file with `git show HEAD:<path> > <path>` instead. Stage explicit paths only — never `git add -A` or `git add .` while any other agent may have in-progress edits. Git tracks files, not directories: never bulk-delete by ignore status or by directory `-name` match, since a gitignored directory can still contain tracked files.
